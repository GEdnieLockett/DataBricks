<h1>DataLake - Dashboarding - AI Query</h1>
  
This project demonstrates the power of **Data Lakes and AI Query Dashboarding** functions to engineer and analyze large datasets at speed and with accuracy. Data Servers were utilised to house tha data. AI query was used to generate Widgets that demontrated the weather patterns.

# Prerequesite  
To run the this project, you will need to have the following software and resources:

 - DataBricks SQL Servers
 - Ai Query - Genie
 - DataBricks Dashboard Tool

# Server Configuration ðŸ”‘
Build a Databricks SQL server on databricks.com. Reivew available data sets, explore data and what potential insights can be gathered.


# Data Analysis ðŸ“Š
Select Sample data from 'Serverless Starter Warehouse'. Query the data using Genie to build tables, graphs and filers.


# Design Theory 
My philosophy of dashboard design is to be simple, consistent and purposeful in data and design.
Each element should have a clear function and all unnessasary data is to be removed.
